# VitDepthNet
Vision-Transformer-Depth-Net (ViTDepthNet) for Depth Estimation
# Vision-Transformer-Depth-Net (ViTDepthNet)

## Introduction
Welcome to the ViTDepthNet repository! This model is designed to enhance depth estimation capabilities by integrating the unique strengths of Vision Transformers (ViT) with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It's optimized for complex indoor scenes and applicable to various fields such as augmented reality and autonomous driving.

## Features
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines the local feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the global contextual understanding of ViTs.
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Tailored for high-precision depth estimation on datasets like NYUv2.
- **Application Versatility**: Ideal for a range of real-world applications from robotics to augmented reality.

## Installation
